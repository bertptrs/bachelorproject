\begin{abstract}

As graph problems are among the most common in various scientific research fields, being able to solve them quickly is wildly applicable. In this thesis, we apply a tuple-based optimization framework to the max flow min cut problem to improve performance in existing algorithms. Using this framework, we create several parallel implementation of the Push-Lift algorithm and test its performance on several relevant data sets.
